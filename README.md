## Installation
First clone this repository into your local repository, then make sure that you have a mysql account, here's a <a href='https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide'>link</a> to help you set up mysql if needed. 

## Usage
First make sure you're in the root of the repository, then open the command line and run `npm i`. After that in the root of the directory create a file named `.env` and in that file write 3 lines: `DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'`, `DB_USER ='<YOUR MYSQL USERNAME>'`, and `DB_PW ='<YOUR MYSQL PASSWORD>'`.
In the command line run `mysql -u <YOUR MYSQL USERNAME> -p`, then enter your password. After you've successfully logged in, run `source db/schema.sql` then `quit;`. After you'll need to seed the data so in the command line run `node seeds`. After this you can run `node server.js` and head to an API design platform like Insomnia and test the CRUD operations in different routes.
